## Design
### Design Choices
The website was designed to be responsive and and easy to navigate with a attractive colour pallette that compliments the goals of the website.

### Colour
For the colour scheme I have opted to implement a dark and light theme while using colours that compliment the goals and ambitions of the website. To narrow down the choice of colours I used [coolors](https://coolors.co/) an example of both the dark and light theme are shown below.

#### Dark Mode

#### Light Mode

### Fonts
 I am using Inter font with a backup of sans-serif across the website for the title and headers. This is used to maintain a Consistent and professional look with an easily readable format. 
<br>
For the Secondary font for the body text the owners decided to use Quicksand with a backup of sans-serif, this will help to maintain the consistent theme across the website.

### Structure
The website has been built using a template engine so that all pages follow the same design to maintain the feel across the website.

The Pages are structured in a Regularly used, user friendly and well-known format. This makes each page easy to navigate, coupled with a responsive navbar and footer this gives the user many options for navigating around the website.

The website consists of 6 pages and an Error Page.
- Home page
- Login page
- Signup page
- Logout page
- Account page
- Recipes page (with a detailed view for each recipe)
- Catagories page (with a separate list for each category)
- Add/ Edit Recipes page
- Error pages (to guide the user back to the main website)
